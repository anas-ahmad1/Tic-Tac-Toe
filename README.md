# Tic-Tac-Toe
This console-based "Tic Tac Toe" game, written in C++, offers two distinct modes: simple Tic Tac Toe and Ultimate Tic Tac Toe. In the Ultimate mode, nine smaller Tic Tac Toe boards are interconnected, with each turn determining the board in which the next player will make their move. The game also includes save and load functionality for user convenience.

**Features:**

**For Simple Tic Tac Toe Mode:**

**For Ultimate Tic Tac Toe Mode:**
* **Nine Interconnected Boards:** Experience a unique twist with Ultimate Tic Tac Toe, consisting of nine smaller Tic Tac Toe boards interconnected as a 3x3 grid.

**Common Features for Both Modes:**
* **New Game Initialization:** Start a new game in either simple or ultimate mode, allowing players to choose their preferred gameplay.
